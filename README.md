## 🌟 **Problem Statement**

Jason Grand, a well-established five-star hotel chain in India, has been in the hospitality industry for over 20 years. Recently, due to competitive strategies and ineffective management decisions, the organization has experienced a decline in both market share and revenue in the luxury/business hotel category. To address this issue, the managing director initiated a plan to integrate Business and Data Intelligence. However, lacking an in-house analytics team, they enlisted a third-party service provider to generate insights from historical data.
